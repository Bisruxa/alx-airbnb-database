-- Partition the Booking table by RANGE on start_date
-- Step 1: Create a new partitioned table
CREATE TABLE booking_partitioned (
    booking_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    property_id INT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    -- other columns as needed
    -- ...
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (start_date) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN ('2024-01-01'),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN ('2025-01-01'),
    PARTITION p2025 VALUES LESS THAN ('2026-01-01'),
    PARTITION pmax VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);

-- Step 2: Example query to test performance on partitioned table
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM booking_partitioned WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-06-30';

-- Step 3: Brief report
-- After partitioning the Booking table by start_date, queries that filter by date range are significantly faster.
-- The database engine scans only the relevant partitions, reducing I/O and improving performance for date-based queries.
