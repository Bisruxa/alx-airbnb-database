--> First normal form (1NF): 
   - Eliminate repeating groups and ensure atomicity.
   - Each table has a primary key and no repeating groups
--> Second normal form (2NF): 
  - Remove partial dependencies.
  - every non key attribute must depend on only the primary key
--> Third normal form (3NF):
  - Remove transitive dependencies.
  - No non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute.
so it is in third normal form
